### Hi there! 👋

I'm a 💻 software engineer working on front-end web development and a bunch of free software projects. I love creating pretty sparkly animated things with great UX. I use 🍎 Macs and 🐧 Gentoo Linux.

#### Some of my projects:

- 🦊 I created the [Firefox GNOME Theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme) project. Now maintained by [Rafael](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai) (thanks a lot for your hard work!).
- 🐿 I made the [Squirrel Tale](https://github.com/lunakurame/squirrel-tale) game in Canvas API from scratch.
- 💾 I wrote a [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/lunakurame/ancient-tictactoe) game for MS-DOS.
- 🤖 I helped [Pizzacus](https://github.com/Pizzacus) with her most devilish Discord bot, [Satania](https://github.com/Pizzacus/SataniaBot).
- 🔔 I contributed to the [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) project which brings desktop notifications to Linux setups.
